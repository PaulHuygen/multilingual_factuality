Current version: 0.1

May 4th 2016.

Preliminary version, see below for near & later future work. 

Covering:

Basic rule system:

1. lemmas and morphology based mapping rules
2. no multiwords/interaction between features
3. no scope (factuality assigned to event as a whole)
4. basic Dutch resources 

System overview:

PREP:

Parse naffile
Read in resources

STEP 1:

Event and feature extraction as described in.
(see feature_description.txt for overview of target events and features).

STEP 2:

Assign default factuality values (CERTAIN, POS, NON_FUTURE) to all events.

STEP 3:

Hierarchical rule based system: any new information overwrites previous observations.
The order of application is based on examples. Interactions between features of different levels (e.g. negation and SIP) are left for future versions.

STEP 4:
Output NAF

Current Rules:

1. Information from target verb itself:

- some verbs have a bias towards the future. If one of these verbs, assign future tense.

Ex:
[en] He is coming (compare: he is smiling)
[du] Hij komt (vs. hij lacht)

2. Information from morphology:

- If the above verbs are in past tense, they are not future (reassign NON-FUTURE) 

Ex:
[en] He came.
[du] Hij kwam.

TODOs:

* What to do with complex factuality values:

He stopped singing (Fact=[CERTAIN,POS,PAST & CERTAIN,NEG,NON_FUTURE])
He starts to sing (Fact=[CERTAIN,NEG,PAST & CERTAIN,POS,PRESENT])
